# Visual Studio Code Tasks

## Introduction

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular and powerful code editor developed by Microsoft. One of its key features is the ability to define and execute tasks directly from within the editor. Tasks are sets of commands that can be executed automatically to perform various actions, such as compiling code, running tests, or executing scripts. In this guide, we'll explore the concept of tasks in VS Code and how to set them up.

## Task Configuration

### Task Runner

VS Code comes with an integrated task runner that allows you to define, configure, and run tasks directly from the editor. The task runner provides a convenient way to automate common development tasks.

### Task Configuration Files

Tasks in VS Code are defined using JSON files known as "tasks.json". These files are typically located in the `.vscode` folder at the root of your project. You can also define global tasks that apply to all projects. To create or edit a task configuration file, use the following steps:

1. Open your project in VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (or `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on macOS) to open the command palette.
3. Search for "Tasks: Configure Task" and select it.
4. Choose either "Create tasks.json file from template" (to create a new file) or "Configure Default Build Task" (to edit an existing file).

## Creating Tasks

### Built-in Tasks

VS Code provides a variety of built-in tasks that cover common scenarios, such as compiling and running code, linting, and more. These tasks can be used as-is or customized to fit your project's needs.

### Custom Tasks

To create custom tasks, you need to define them in the `tasks.json` configuration file. Each task consists of properties like "label," "type," "command," "args," and more. You can specify the task details and customize them based on your project requirements.

Here's an example of a custom task from typical ROS project:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "ros2-build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "cd ros_ws && colcon build",
            "problemMatcher": [],
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "silent",
                "revealProblems": "onProblem",
                "close": true
            }
        },
        {
            "label": "launch-simulator",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "source ros_ws/install/local_setup.bash && ros2 launch scheduler simulator.launch.py",
            "problemMatcher": [],
            "dependsOn": ["build"]
        },
        {
            "label": "build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "echo -e 'Done building, simulation is ready!'",
            "problemMatcher": [],
            "dependsOn": ["ros2-build"],
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "silent",
                "revealProblems": "onProblem",
                "close": true
            }
        },

    ]
}
```
## Task Execution
### Running Tasks
To run a task, follow these steps:

Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (or `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on macOS) to open the command palette.
Search for `"Tasks: Run Task"` and select it.
Choose the task you want to run from the list.

### Task Output
When a task is executed, its output is displayed in the integrated terminal within VS Code. This terminal provides real-time feedback on the task's progress and any errors or warnings that may occur.

## Task Variants
Task variants allow you to define multiple configurations for the same task. This is useful when you need to run the same task with different arguments or settings. Variants help streamline your workflow by reducing the need to duplicate tasks.

## Task Shortcuts
VS Code allows you to define keyboard shortcuts to quickly execute tasks without navigating through the command palette. You can customize these shortcuts based on your preferences.

## Conclusion
Visual Studio Code's task feature provides a powerful way to automate repetitive development tasks, making your workflow more efficient and productive. By configuring and running tasks, you can streamline your development process and focus on writing code rather than managing manual tasks.
