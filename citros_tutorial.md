# Overview
* Some explanation about the project and the `incentive` of using CITROS. 
** (this can sound a little like a "salesmen" : only CITROS platform give me the ability to run multiple simulations at the same time and analyse the results in a single place at ease)

# Prerequisites
* CITROS installation + configuration -> Overview Getting Started Tutorial.
* Specific per project (if not using dockers).(what packages should be installed, more info?)
